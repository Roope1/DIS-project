If you have docker and docker compose installed and working, 
the databases can be started with `docker compose up -d` in this directory. 
Shutting down the databases happens with the command `docker compose down`
The databases start up on ports 5432, 5433 and 5434. 
The username for all databases is "postgres" and the password is "password"
